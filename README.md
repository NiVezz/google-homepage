The Odin Project - 1: Copy of Google Homepage

This is my first project for The Odin Project. The goal is to make a copy of the Google Homepage in HTML and CSS. The intent of the project is to copy the visual design on the website and not to worry about the functionality.

By the end of this project I should have displayed the ability to move objects around on a webpage with HTML & CSS.
